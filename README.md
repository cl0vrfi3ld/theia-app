# how to interact with this repository

this app is currently in prerelease, meaning that `main` branch code is, well, dated. releases are built from the `prerelease` branch and development happens on the `dev` branch. i **strongly** advise you to **NOT** build from the `main` branch while the app is in it's prerelease stage. again, the main branch will **NOT** be updated until the app is ready for full release, so please direct your beautiful eyes to the `prerelease` branch, thanks!

# a fair warning

this code is MESSY! this was intended as a personal exercise to learn svelte and electron, so please note this was my first time working with these tools. however, should you want to, pr's are always welcome.

i'm also currently a student, which restricts the time i have to "manage" this repo, meaning it may take me a bit to respond to your issue/pr.

# that's all i have for now 
happy hacking, and may your illegally downloaded music library remain ever growing!
